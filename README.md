# webpack-fundamentals

Test out webpack

- npm install webpack -g [install webpack globally]
- webpack ./app.js bundle.js [builds webpack bundle for app.js]
- we add a config file to webpack to give it it's settings
	- A config file in webpack is a commonjs module
	- After we have a config file we can use just the webpack command to build the app.
- Watch mode
	- In command line type "webpack --watch" will take it to watch mode
    - Or in config set "watch: true"
